This online annotation event, which took place asynchronously from Monday, November 16 to Friday, November 20, was an opportunity for our community of scholars to engage differently and collectively with a text whose significance for our Americas has been long-standing, transregional, and profound. Over the course of five days, we invited folks to use the digital editing tool hypothes.is to help enrich a new digital <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://cahier1939ms.github.io/texts/simple/">edition of the French original</a> by Kora Verón and <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://cahier1939ms.github.io/texts/translation/">original translation by Kaiama L. Glover and Alex Gil</a> of Aimé Césaire’s <em>Notebook of a Return to My Native Land</em>--a version that, through a process of generative layering, now amounts to a rich multimedia paratext to Césaire’s extraordinary text. The week began with a 45-minute tool-acquisition tutorial, after which the proverbial floor was opened. In 2019 <em>archipelagos journal</em> hosted a similar event as an exercise in digital peer review, around Laurent Dubois, David Kirkland Garner, and Mary Caton Lingold’s website <em>Musical Passage</em>. A full account of that marvelous experiment can be found in <a href="http://archipelagosjournal.org/issue03/dubois-garner-lingold.html">archipelagos (4).</a>

While the official event has closed, the site remains public and open for further engagement. Should you decide to join the conversation with our community, please consider <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Z1tO3pNofYQuQGG_rDb2Q962pxBjRA004XRB60pgU-c/edit">signing up here</a>, so we have a record of your participation. And if you are new to hypothes.is, you can learn more about it and create an account [on their website](https://web.hypothes.is/).
