This collaborative curation of digital resources concerning the Caribbean and its diasporas engages the community in compiling entries in an open, shared online dataset. Over the course of two months, contributors co-produced an online directory that allows users to browse, preview, and search a comprehensive, open-source bibliographical archive. We hope this will be the beginning of a tradition we can repeat in subsequent years to enrich this dynamic community resource.

Having gathered contributions by inviting folks to add projects directly to [our open data sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PfgI0GrQR60gwRFVIZmZtWae9JyAMpZNFOZRe5xsMsg/edit#gid=0), we subsequently built a website for our <a href="https://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/caridischo/">Directory</a> and released the final version on the day of our conference.
