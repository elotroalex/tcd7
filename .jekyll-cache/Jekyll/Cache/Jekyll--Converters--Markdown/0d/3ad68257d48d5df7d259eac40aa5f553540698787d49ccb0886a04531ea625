<p>This project aims to build a collection of words that serve as rich sites for research and pedagogy in Caribbean Studies. Beginning in October, we will crowd-source a collection of keywords, choosing three to five for further exploration. Individuals or teams of Caribbean Digital participants will then curate digital artifacts related to their chosen keyword, with a short introduction grouping the artifacts. Potential keywords include diaspora, colonial/postcolonial, gender, race, history, language, sound, sexuality, and community. Modeled on the recently completed MLA <a href="https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/">Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities</a>, edited by Rebecca Frost Davis, Matthew K. Gold, Katherine D. Harris, and Jentery Sayers, this Keywords for Caribbean Studies collection is intended to be the beginning of a project that will grow with future Caribbean Digital events.</p>

<p>The collection will be launched at the Caribbean Digital event on 4 December 2020.</p>
