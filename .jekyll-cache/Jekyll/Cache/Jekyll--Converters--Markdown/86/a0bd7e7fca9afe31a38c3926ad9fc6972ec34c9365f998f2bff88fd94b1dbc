<p>This online annotation event, which is <strong>taking place asynchronously from Monday, November 16 to Friday, November 20</strong>, is an opportunity for our community of scholars to engage differently and collectively with a text whose significance for our Americas has been long-standing, transregional, and profound. Over the course of five days, you are invited to use the digital editing tool hypothes.is to help enrich a new digital <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://cahier1939ms.github.io/texts/simple/">edition of the French original</a> by Kora Ver√≥n and <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://cahier1939ms.github.io/texts/translation/">original translation by Kaiama Glover and Alex Gil</a> of Aim√© C√©saire‚Äôs <em>Notebook of a Return to My Native Land</em>‚Äîa version that, through a process of generative layering, will incorporate scholarly, artistic, ‚Äútraditional,‚Äù and multimedia paratext to C√©saire‚Äôs extraordinary text. The week will begin with a 45-minute tool-acquisition tutorial, after which the proverbial floor will be open. In 2019 <em>archipelagos journal</em> hosted a similar event as an exercise in digital peer review, around Laurent Dubois, David Kirkland Garner, and Mary Caton Lingold‚Äôs website <em>Musical Passage</em>. A full account of that marvelous experiment can be found in <a href="http://archipelagosjournal.org/issue03/dubois-garner-lingold.html">archipelagos (4).</a></p>

<p>Please consider <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Z1tO3pNofYQuQGG_rDb2Q962pxBjRA004XRB60pgU-c/edit">signing up here</a> as well, so we have a record of participation.
