<p>This online annotation event, which will take place asynchronously <strong>November 16-20&lt;/a&gt;</strong>, is an opportunity for our community of scholars to engage differently and collectively with a text whose significance for our Americas has been long-standing, transregional, and profound. Over the course of five days, participants will be invited to use the digital editing tool <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/about/">hypothes.is</a> to help enrich a new digital edition and translation of Aim√© C√©saire‚Äôs <em>Notebook of a Return to My Native Land</em>‚Äîa version that, through a process of generative layering, will incorporate scholarly, artistic, ‚Äútraditional,‚Äù and multimedia paratext to C√©saire‚Äôs extraordinary text. The week will begin with a 45-minute tool-acquisition tutorial, after which the proverbial floor will be open. In 2019 <em>archipelagos journal</em> hosted a similar event as an exercise in digital peer review, around Laurent Dubois, David Kirkland Garner, and Mary Caton Lingold‚Äôs website <em>Musical Passage</em>. A full account of that marvelous experiment can be found in <a href="http://archipelagosjournal.org/issue03/dubois-garner-lingold.html">arch(4).</a></p>
