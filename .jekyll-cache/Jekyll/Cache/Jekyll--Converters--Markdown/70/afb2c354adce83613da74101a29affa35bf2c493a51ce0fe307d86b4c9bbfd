<p>This project aimed to build a collection of words that serve as rich sites for research and pedagogy in Caribbean Studies. Beginning in October, we crowd-sourced a collection of keywords and chose twelve for further exploration. Individuals or teams of Caribbean Digital participants then curated digital artifacts related to their chosen keyword, with a short introduction grouping the artifacts. Modeled on the recently completed MLA <a href="https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/">Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities</a>, edited by Rebecca Frost Davis, Matthew K. Gold, Katherine D. Harris, and Jentery Sayers, this <a href="https://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/keywords/">Keywords for Caribbean Studies</a> collection marks the beginning of a project that will grow with future Caribbean Digital events.</p>

<p>The collection was launched at the Caribbean Digital event on 4 December 2020.</p>
