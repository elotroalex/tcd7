<h2 id="yarimar-bonilla">Yarimar Bonilla</h2>

<p>… teaches and writes about questions of sovereignty, citizenship, and race across the Americas. Her first book, <em>Non-Sovereign Futures: French Caribbean Politics in the Wake of Disenchantment</em>, examines how contemporary activists in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe imagine and contest the limits of postcolonial sovereignty. Professor Bonilla’s second book project <em>American Disaster</em>—for which she was named a 2018 Carnegie Fellow—examines the politics of recovery in Puerto Rico after hurricane Maria and the forms of political and social trauma that the storm revealed. She is also at work on an ethnographic study of the Puerto Rican pro-statehood movement, tentatively titled “The Unthinkable State,” which considers annexationism as a form of anti-colonial politics. Professor Bonilla has a strong interest in the role of digital technologies within social movements and academic practice. She has theorized hashtag usage within the context of the Black Lives Matter movement and the semiotics of digital protest in the context of Guadeloupe. She is currently developing a multi-media political atlas of the Caribbean entitled, <a href="https://vimeo.com/169690419">Visualizing Sovereignty</a> and is a principal collaborator in the <a href="https://puertoricosyllabus.com/">#PuertoRicoSyllabus project</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ruddy-roye">Ruddy Roye</h2>

<p>… is a Brooklyn based documentary photographer specializing in editorial and environmental portraits and photo-journalism photography. A photographer with over twelve years of experience, Radcliffe is inspired by the raw and gritty lives of grass-roots people, especially those of his homeland of Jamaica. Radcliffe strives to tell the stories of their victories and ills by bringing their voices to matte fibre paper. Recently, Radcliffe began experimenting with interpretative photography, preferring to allow the abstract content within the frame to dictate the voice and purpose of the image. His Elements series focuses on the bold, austere, graphic and emotionally raw imagery, that is trapped behind a diffused lens. With painterly abilities, Radcliffe uses this diffused methodology to subtly awake the subconscious and expose the isolated figure or vision painted within a rhetorical frame.</p>
